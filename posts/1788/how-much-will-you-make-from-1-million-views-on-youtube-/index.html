We all know that YouTube pays its creators handsomely for the content they create, but how does one get to 1 million views? And what can you expect to make? Let’s find out! Do you ever wonder what it’s like to make money through YouTube? It’s a common question and the answer may surprise you. In this article, we’ll explore how much money you can make from 1 million views on YouTube.\nIt’s no secret that YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for making money online. Every day, millions of people use YouTube to upload their videos and make money. But how much money could you really make from 1 million views?\nThe answer depends on several factors, such as the type of video you produce and the advertising revenue you generate. Generally, the more popular your video is, the more money you can make. However, it’s important to remember that the exact amount of money you can make from 1 million views will vary based on your audience and the type of video you produce.\nOn average, you can usually expect to make anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 from 1 million views on YouTube. Of course, this isn’t a guaranteed amount of money and it doesn’t include any additional income that could be generated from ad revenue or sponsorships.\nIf you’re serious about making money on YouTube, you’ll need to put in hard work and dedication to see results. It can be challenging to create videos that attract a large audience and generate a steady stream of income. However, if you can manage to make a name for yourself online, you could very well be on your way to making thousands of dollars from 1 million views on YouTube.\nAccording to YouTube, “On average, a YouTube channel can make $18 per 1,000 views, and that number can increase to upwards of $25 per 1,000 in some cases. That means a YouTuber with a million views can make anywhere from $18,000 to $25,000”\nAccording to analytics firm SocialBlade, “Even a channel with a few thousand views per month can start to be profitable, with the average channel on YouTube earning $2 – $5 per 1,000 video views.”\nAccording to Forbes, “A YouTuber with 1 million views can expect to make between $2,000 and $40,000 from those views, depending on how many people click on the ads. However, the amount of money you make from 1 million views will depend on a variety of factors, including the type of videos you upload, the number of subscribers you have, and the quality of your content.”\nA Comprehensive Guide to Calculating Youtube Monetization Earnings\nUnlock Million Views Income 1. Overview of Revenue Potential from 1 Million Views on YouTube YouTube has become a major platform for content creators since its inception in 2005. It has become the largest video platform in the world, and thousands of creators are making a living from their videos. One of the most common questions content creators have is how much money they can make from 1 million views on YouTube.\nAdvertisers pay YouTube based on the number of views, so the more views a video has, the more money it can generate. YouTube typically pays $2 to $5 per thousand views, so 1 million views could generate anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000. This is just an estimate, as YouTube also takes into account location, device type, engagement rate, and more when it comes to calculating payments.\nHowever, there are also other ways to monetize your YouTube channel that can increase the amount of money you make from 1 million views. You could join an affiliate program, where you refer viewers to a product and get a commission when they purchase it. Or, you can create your own products and services to market and sell to your fans. Additionally, you could open a merchandise store where viewers can buy merchandise related to your channel.\nIn conclusion, the amount of money you make from 1 million views on YouTube can vary depending on how you monetize your channel. However, you can maximize your earnings by diversifying your revenue streams and engaging with your audience. With the right strategy, you can make a lot of money from your 1 million views.\n2. Overview of Potential Business Opportunities with 1 Million Views on YouTube It’s no secret that YouTube creators can make money from their videos. But most people don’t know exactly How Much Will You Make from 1 Million Views on YouTube. To get a better understanding of the revenue potential of YouTube videos, it’s helpful to take a look at some real-world examples of successful video creators and the revenue they’ve earned from 1 million views. In general, the amount of revenue you make from 1 million views depends on how much time and effort you put into making quality content and how large your audience is. For most YouTube creators, ads are the primary source of revenue, so views are the main factor in determining how much you make. But you can also earn revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions, Super Chat payments, and affiliate sales. With the right strategy in place, you can make thousands of dollars from 1 million views on YouTube.\n3. Advantages of Reaching 1 Million Views for Your Business Reaching one million views on a YouTube video is no easy feat. With so much competition out there, the growth of a channel can be a difficult and frustrating process. But, don’t worry! It is possible to make money with 1 million views on YouTube and even turn your channel into a business. When used correctly, one million views can be a powerful tool for kickstarting a channel’s potential of earning revenue. Adsense is the most common way to make money from a YouTube channel. It works by placing advertisements in videos and paying the creator money for each click. With 1 million views, a YouTube channel can expect to make between $1,000 and $5,000 from Adsense alone. Affiliate marketing is another great way to monetize a YouTube channel. It works by promoting another product or service inside the video and earning a commission for each sale. A channel with 1 million views can expect to make around $1000 to $3000 in affiliate sales. Merchandise is also an option. This allows the creator to put their own logo and products onto clothing, mugs, and other items to sell. With 1 million views, the potential for increased merchandise sales is significant. With these three methods, the revenue potential from 1 million views on YouTube is clear.\n4. Strategies for Growing Your YouTube Channel to 1 Million Views With the rise of social media, it has become increasingly simple to share content with the world and monetize it for personal gain. YouTube is no exception to this rule; earning money from content shared on YouTube is now a viable way to bring in a healthy income. How much can you make from a million views on YouTube? In this article, we will explore the various revenue potentials and see how much money you can make from 1 million views on YouTube.\nYouTube pays creators when their ads and videos are watched; this varies depending on the nature of the video, the niche market, and the type of ad. For example, when a viewer watches an ad, the advertiser pays YouTube, which in turn pays the video creator. Generally, ad rates are considered on a Cost Per Thousand (CPM) basis, so a thousand views of an ad could generate a certain amount of money.\nYouTube also enables its creators to become YouTube partners and make money from their content through various methods. Firstly, creators can earn money directly from YouTube by joining their Partner Program, which is a great way to bring in a consistent and steady income. In addition to this, YouTube also allows content creators to become members of their YouTube Monetization Program, which allows them to collect a portion of the money generated from ads.\nFinally, YouTube also has a system that rewards content creators with money from super chats, which is when viewers pay real money or virtual currency to leave comments on a live stream. These super chats are displayed prominently, bringing attention to the content creator.\nIn conclusion, building a successful YouTube channel is a great way to generate income for yourself. By understanding the various revenue potentials from 1 million views on YouTube, you can generate a healthy and consistent income.\n5. Tips for Monetizing Your Channel After You Reach 1 Million Views Do you ever wonder how much money you could make from reaching 1 million views on YouTube? With the right strategy, you could generate a significant revenue stream from your videos. On an average, YouTubers can make anywhere between $500 to $5,000 for every million views they garner. It doesn’t matter what kind of videos you post; if you have the right audience, there is potential to make some serious money.\nThe amount a YouTuber gets paid depends on the type of ad the viewer watches, the CPI, and how often the video is monetized. The CPI depends on several factors, including the user’s location and the type of content they watch. It’s also important to consider that different ad networks have different rates, so it’s important to do research about the networks you’re using.\nAnother element that will factor into your revenue is the number of views the video gets. Videos that get more views will generate more revenue, as more people will be exposed to the ads. That means that YouTubers need to work hard to promote their videos and get as many views as possible.\nFinally, YouTubers need to make sure their videos have some form of monetization enabled. This means enabling ads or signing up for revenue-sharing programs, such as the YouTube Partner Program. This will ensure that you get paid for each view your video receives. With the right content, the right audience, and the right monetization strategies, YouTubers can make a great living off of the 1 million views milestone.\n2. Factors Affecting Potential Revenue from 1 Million Views When you think about making money on YouTube, you probably envision an income of one million views. But how much does that actually equate to in real-world dollars? The answer depends on a few factors.\nAdSense is the most common way to monetize YouTube views. AdSense revenue is based on advertisement clicks and the amount of ad views throughout a certain period. The number of clicks and views is dependent on both the quality of the content and the quality of the advertisement.\nContent must be engaging to viewers in order to ensure that ads will be clicked on. If a video is poorly made or lacks interest, viewers are less likely to click on ads and generate revenue for the creator. Additionally, video makers can increase monetization potential by providing more context surrounding their content, such as annotations and external links, which can encourage viewers to check out other similar content.\nFinally, the CPM (cost per mille or cost per thousand views) varies across countries. Generally, viewers in the United States generate the highest CPM, with viewers in other countries generating lower CPMs. Thus, a million views in the US may yield higher earnings than the same number of views in another country.\n1. Advantages of Using YouTube as a Business Platform When it comes to measuring success on YouTube, the number of views is an important factor. However, many YouTube creators are curious to know how much they can make from 1 million views. The answer to this question isn’t as straightforward as you might think as there are several factors that affect potential revenue from 1 million views.\nThe first factor is type of ads. Generally, YouTube pays its creators based on the Cost Per Mille (CPM) rate of the ads. This means that YouTube pays you based on how much they are earning from the ads. If the ads get more CPM, you will earn more.\nThe second factor is the type of video content. Creator’s who create content related to trending topics often get better CPM rates than content related to less popular topics. Additionally, video content with higher production value also tends to attract more retainer viewers which enhances the chance of earning more from 1 million views.\nThe third factor is the target audience. YouTube provides an audience segmentation which allows you to understand what kind of audience you are targeting. If you are creating content that appeals to a highly valuable audience such as C-level executives or entrepreneurs, you may be able to generate more revenue from 1 million views.\nFinally, the biggest factor affecting potential revenue from 1 million views is the number of ads. Generally, YouTube pays its creators based on the number of ads served on their video. To increase the number of ads served on their video, YouTube creators should include annotations and add cards. Both of these features allow viewers to interact with the ads more and increases potential revenue from 1 million views.\n2. Factors Affecting Potential Revenue from 1 Million Views The current online landscape has enabled anyone to make money from the comfort of their own homes. With a video streaming platform such as YouTube, anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can monetize their content. If you’re wondering how much you can make from 1 million views on YouTube, there are a few factors that you should keep in mind. Firstly, the video monetization platform like YouTube will take a percentage of your earnings. Secondly, the amount you will make from 1 million views also depends on the kind of content you create. Thirdly, the country that you are based in will affect the revenue you can generate from 1 million views on YouTube. Lastly, the amount of ad revenue that you can generate from 1 million views is also dependant on the demographics of your viewers and engagement rate. Taking all these into consideration will help you estimate how much you can make from 1 million views on YouTube.\n3. Strategies to Maximize Revenue from 1 Million Views on YouTube With a bit of hard work and creativity, it is possible to earn money from YouTube videos. With 1 million views, the potential to earn a significant revenue is very real. Here are a few strategies to maximize revenue from 1 million views on YouTube.\nFirstly, create compelling content. Ensure that the content of the video is unique, entertaining and provides viewers with value. This will help garner a huge following and keep them engaged and actively watching the video.\nSecondly, promote the video using social media websites. This will be a major factor in helping the video reach 1 million views. Make sure to target accounts, groups and subcultures that are likely to be interested in the content of the video.\nThirdly, use appropriate keywords and tags to promote the video so that it appears on searches. This will help viewers find the video more easily and again, increase the potential to reach 1 million views.\nFinally, make sure to use advertisements as a source of revenue. YouTube pays advertisers for views that the video receives. Thus, when 1 million views are achieved, the revenue from the ads will also significantly increase.\n1. Overview of YouTube Monetization The potential for revenue from 1 million YouTube views is substantial. However, to maximize your earnings from these views, you need to be aware of the strategies that you can employ. Making sure that you are optimizing your channel and audience can go a long way in increasing your revenue. Here are some of the best strategies you can use to maximize your earnings from 1 million YouTube views.\nFirst, understanding what type of content your audience wants is key. Knowing what type of content your viewers are looking for can help you create videos that are more likely to be watched and enjoyed. Additionally, using promotional tools like AdSense and affiliate links can help you monetize your views and make more money from them.\nSecond, optimizing your video content is essential. This includes creating titles and tags that are relevant to your video content, as well as optimizing the overall quality of the video. This will help boost your views and ensure that you are getting the most out of each one.\nThird, being active on social media is crucial to driving views and improving your SEO. Creating accounts on various social media platforms and being active with your audience can help boost your organic reach and help you gain more views. Additionally, engaging with your audience and responding to their comments is an important way to show them that you care.\nFinally, building relationships with other creators can help you maximize your earnings from 1 million views on YouTube. Collaborations with other content creators can help spread the word about your channel and draw more viewers to your channel. This can not only help you increase your revenue, but also help both of you grow your channels further.\n2. Maximizing Your Revenue from 1 Million Views on YouTube YouTube offers plenty of opportunities to earn money from your videos. With 1 million views, you can maximize your revenue by following a few strategies. First, use YouTube Analytics to get insights into viewers’ engagement and success. Analyzing data can help you create more content that resonates with your audience. Secondly, think about diversifying revenue streams to maximize earnings. Utilize YouTube’s advertising program to monetize your content. Additionally, embed affiliate links in the video description for additional income. Finally, collaborate with other popular YouTube channels or influencers to reach a wider audience and create paid sponsorship deal. By taking these steps, you can get the most out of 1 million views and turn it into a viable business opportunity.\nQ: How much money can you make from 1 million views on YouTube?\nA: The amount of money you can make from 1 million views on YouTube varies depending on a few factors. Your ad revenue will be determined by the number of ad impressions, how much advertisers are willing to pay, the number of clicks, and what kind of ad it is. On average, you can expect to make around $3,000 for 1 million views, but this can vary widely depending on the content of your video.\n","wordCount":"3100","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-06-18T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Steve Smalls"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kimorlowski.github.io/posts/1788/how-much-will-you-make-from-1-million-views-on-youtube-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kim Orlowski","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kimorlowski.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://kimorlowski.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Kim Orlowski (Alt + H)"><img src=https://kimorlowski.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Kim Orlowski</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://kimorlowski.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://kimorlowski.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://kimorlowski.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://kimorlowski.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>How Much Will You Make from 1 Million Views on YouTube?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-06-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 18, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;15 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;3100 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Steve Smalls</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#1-overview-of-revenue-potential-from-1-million-views-on-youtube>1.

This is just an estimate, as YouTube also takes into account location, device type, engagement rate, and more when it comes to calculating payments.</p><p>However, there are also other ways to monetize your YouTube channel that can increase the amount of money you make from 1 million views. You could join an affiliate program, where you refer viewers to a product and get a commission when they purchase it. Or, you can create your own products and services to market and sell to your fans. Additionally, you could open a merchandise store where viewers can buy merchandise related to your channel.</p><p>In conclusion, the amount of money you make from 1 million views on YouTube can vary depending on how you monetize your channel. However, you can maximize your earnings by diversifying your revenue streams and engaging with your audience. With the right strategy, you can make a lot of money from your 1 million views.</p><h3 id=2-overview-of-potential-business-opportunities-with-1-million-views-on-youtube>2. Overview of Potential Business Opportunities with 1 Million Views on YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-overview-of-potential-business-opportunities-with-1-million-views-on-youtube>#</a></h3><p>It&rsquo;s no secret that YouTube creators can make money from their videos. But most people don&rsquo;t know exactly How Much Will You Make from 1 Million Views on YouTube. To get a better understanding of the revenue potential of YouTube videos, it&rsquo;s helpful to take a look at some real-world examples of successful video creators and the revenue they&rsquo;ve earned from 1 million views. In general, the amount of revenue you make from 1 million views depends on how much time and effort you put into making quality content and how large your audience is. For most YouTube creators, ads are the primary source of revenue, so views are the main factor in determining how much you make. But you can also earn revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions, Super Chat payments, and affiliate sales. With the right strategy in place, you can make thousands of dollars from 1 million views on YouTube.</p><h3 id=3-advantages-of-reaching-1-million-views-for-your-business>3. Advantages of Reaching 1 Million Views for Your Business<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-advantages-of-reaching-1-million-views-for-your-business>#</a></h3><p>Reaching one million views on a YouTube video is no easy feat. With so much competition out there, the growth of a channel can be a difficult and frustrating process. But, don’t worry! It is possible to make money with 1 million views on YouTube and even turn your channel into a business. When used correctly, one million views can be a powerful tool for kickstarting a channel’s potential of earning revenue. Adsense is the most common way to make money from a YouTube channel. It works by placing advertisements in videos and paying the creator money for each click. With 1 million views, a YouTube channel can expect to make between $1,000 and $5,000 from Adsense alone. Affiliate marketing is another great way to monetize a YouTube channel. It works by promoting another product or service inside the video and earning a commission for each sale. A channel with 1 million views can expect to make around $1000 to $3000 in affiliate sales. Merchandise is also an option. This allows the creator to put their own logo and products onto clothing, mugs, and other items to sell. With 1 million views, the potential for increased merchandise sales is significant. With these three methods, the revenue potential from 1 million views on YouTube is clear.</p><h3 id=4-strategies-for-growing-your-youtube-channel-to-1-million-views>4. Strategies for Growing Your YouTube Channel to 1 Million Views<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-strategies-for-growing-your-youtube-channel-to-1-million-views>#</a></h3><p>With the rise of social media, it has become increasingly simple to share content with the world and monetize it for personal gain. YouTube is no exception to this rule; earning money from content shared on YouTube is now a viable way to bring in a healthy income. How much can you make from a million views on YouTube? In this article, we will explore the various revenue potentials and see how much money you can make from 1 million views on YouTube.</p><p>YouTube pays creators when their ads and videos are watched; this varies depending on the nature of the video, the niche market, and the type of ad. For example, when a viewer watches an ad, the advertiser pays YouTube, which in turn pays the video creator. Generally, ad rates are considered on a Cost Per Thousand (CPM) basis, so a thousand views of an ad could generate a certain amount of money.</p><p>YouTube also enables its creators to become YouTube partners and make money from their content through various methods. Firstly, creators can earn money directly from YouTube by joining their Partner Program, which is a great way to bring in a consistent and steady income. In addition to this, YouTube also allows content creators to become members of their YouTube Monetization Program, which allows them to collect a portion of the money generated from ads.</p><p>Finally, YouTube also has a system that rewards content creators with money from super chats, which is when viewers pay real money or virtual currency to leave comments on a live stream. These super chats are displayed prominently, bringing attention to the content creator.</p><p>In conclusion, building a successful YouTube channel is a great way to generate income for yourself. By understanding the various revenue potentials from 1 million views on YouTube, you can generate a healthy and consistent income.</p><h3 id=5-tips-for-monetizing-your-channel-after-you-reach-1-million-views>5. Tips for Monetizing Your Channel After You Reach 1 Million Views<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-tips-for-monetizing-your-channel-after-you-reach-1-million-views>#</a></h3><p>Do you ever wonder how much money you could make from reaching 1 million views on YouTube? With the right strategy, you could generate a significant revenue stream from your videos. On an average, YouTubers can make anywhere between $500 to $5,000 for every million views they garner. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of videos you post; if you have the right audience, there is potential to make some serious money.</p><p>The amount a YouTuber gets paid depends on the type of ad the viewer watches, the CPI, and how often the video is monetized. The CPI depends on several factors, including the user&rsquo;s location and the type of content they watch. It&rsquo;s also important to consider that different ad networks have different rates, so it&rsquo;s important to do research about the networks you&rsquo;re using.</p><p>Another element that will factor into your revenue is the number of views the video gets. Videos that get more views will generate more revenue, as more people will be exposed to the ads. That means that YouTubers need to work hard to promote their videos and get as many views as possible.</p><p>Finally, YouTubers need to make sure their videos have some form of monetization enabled. This means enabling ads or signing up for revenue-sharing programs, such as the YouTube Partner Program. This will ensure that you get paid for each view your video receives. With the right content, the right audience, and the right monetization strategies, YouTubers can make a great living off of the 1 million views milestone.</p><h2 id=2-factors-affecting-potential-revenue-from-1-million-views>2. Factors Affecting Potential Revenue from 1 Million Views<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-factors-affecting-potential-revenue-from-1-million-views>#</a></h2><p>When you think about making money on YouTube, you probably envision an income of one million views. But how much does that actually equate to in real-world dollars? The answer depends on a few factors.</p><p>AdSense is the most common way to monetize YouTube views. AdSense revenue is based on advertisement clicks and the amount of ad views throughout a certain period. The number of clicks and views is dependent on both the quality of the content and the quality of the advertisement.</p><p>Content must be engaging to viewers in order to ensure that ads will be clicked on. If a video is poorly made or lacks interest, viewers are less likely to click on ads and generate revenue for the creator. Additionally, video makers can increase monetization potential by providing more context surrounding their content, such as annotations and external links, which can encourage viewers to check out other similar content.</p><p>Finally, the CPM (cost per mille or cost per thousand views) varies across countries. Generally, viewers in the United States generate the highest CPM, with viewers in other countries generating lower CPMs. Thus, a million views in the US may yield higher earnings than the same number of views in another country.</p><h3 id=1-advantages-of-using-youtube-as-a-business-platform>1. Advantages of Using YouTube as a Business Platform<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-advantages-of-using-youtube-as-a-business-platform>#</a></h3><p>When it comes to measuring success on YouTube, the number of views is an important factor. However, many YouTube creators are curious to know how much they can make from 1 million views. The answer to this question isn&rsquo;t as straightforward as you might think as there are several factors that affect potential revenue from 1 million views.</p><p>The first factor is type of ads. Generally, YouTube pays its creators based on the Cost Per Mille (CPM) rate of the ads. This means that YouTube pays you based on how much they are earning from the ads. If the ads get more CPM, you will earn more.</p><p>The second factor is the type of video content. Creator&rsquo;s who create content related to trending topics often get better CPM rates than content related to less popular topics. Additionally, video content with higher production value also tends to attract more retainer viewers which enhances the chance of earning more from 1 million views.</p><p>The third factor is the target audience. YouTube provides an audience segmentation which allows you to understand what kind of audience you are targeting. If you are creating content that appeals to a highly valuable audience such as C-level executives or entrepreneurs, you may be able to generate more revenue from 1 million views.</p><p>Finally, the biggest factor affecting potential revenue from 1 million views is the number of ads. Generally, YouTube pays its creators based on the number of ads served on their video. To increase the number of ads served on their video, YouTube creators should include annotations and add cards. Both of these features allow viewers to interact with the ads more and increases potential revenue from 1 million views.</p><h3 id=2-factors-affecting-potential-revenue-from-1-million-views-1>2.
