It’s important to keep an eye on these guidelines, as they are continually updated to ensure that they are up to date with the latest changes in the platform. Understanding these guidelines and making adjustments accordingly can help you optimize your earnings. Additionally, YouTube requires that your channel meets certain criteria in order to be eligible for monetization. This includes having at least 4,000 watch hours in the past year and 1,000 subscribers.
