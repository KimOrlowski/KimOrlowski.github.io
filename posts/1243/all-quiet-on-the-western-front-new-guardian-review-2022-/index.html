Negatives of the Film<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ii-negatives-of-the-film>#</a></h3><p>The new remake of All Quiet on the Western Front, distributed by the Guardian, has received mixed reviews since its premiere in 2022. The film is a faithful adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque&rsquo;s classic 1929 novel of the same name, which tells the story of a German soldier fighting in World War I. Some critics praise the film for its unflinching portrayal of the horrors of war and its nuanced exploration of the psychological toll that combat takes on soldiers. Others cite the film&rsquo;s length as a major drawback. While it clocks in at two and a half hours, the film arguably drags at times, as some of the more emotionally affecting scenes are repeated often to emphasize the protagonist&rsquo;s slowly deteriorating mental health. Additionally, some viewers have criticized the audible dialogue and sound design, claiming it is often too loud or out of place. On the whole, All Quiet on the Western Front offers a compelling, if protracted, exploration of the wrenching consequences of war.</p><h2 id=3-conclusion-on-all-quiet-on-the-western-front---new-guardian-review-2022>3.
