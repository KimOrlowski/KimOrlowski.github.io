Eating more plant-based foods can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help preserve the environment. Furthermore, plant-based foods cost less and offer more variety than animal-based foods, making them a great choice for those looking to save money while eating healthy.\nOverall, a 90/10 plant-based diet can help provide the necessary nutrients and the potential health and environmental benefits that come with it. Thus, anyone looking for an easy and effective approach to improve their health and the health of the planet should give the 90/10 plant-based diet a try.\n3. Potential Health Benefits of a 90/10 Plant-Based Diet Recent research has shown that a plant-based diet can have significant health benefits, and one of the most popular varieties is the 90/10 plant-based diet. The 90/10 plant-based diet focuses on including mostly plant-based foods with some animal-based foods, creating a balance between vegan and omnivore diets. This allows for a more varied diet while still being largely plant-based and has been linked to positive outcomes such as improved health and lower cholesterol levels.\nThe 90/10 plant-based diet is made up of 90% plant-based foods and 10% animal-based foods. This includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and healthy fats, along with a small amount of animal-based foods such as eggs, fish, and dairy. This allows for a wider variety of foods than a strict vegan or vegetarian diet, and can provide a range of nutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids.\nThe 90/10 plant-based diet has been linked to a number of health benefits, including improved heart health, weight loss, and cholesterol levels. Studies have also linked it to reduced risks of certain conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers. This is due to the wide range of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients found in plant-based foods, which can reduce inflammation and protect against chronic disease.\nOverall, the 90/10 plant-based diet is a great way to benefit from a largely plant-based diet while still enjoying a variety of foods. This diet can help improve heart health, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall health and wellbeing. It’s important to include a range of plant-based foods and animal-based foods in order to get all the necessary nutrients, and to consult a healthcare professional if you have any questions or concerns.\n2. Review of Research About This Diet In recent years, the popularity of the 90/10 plant-based diet has increased significantly.
