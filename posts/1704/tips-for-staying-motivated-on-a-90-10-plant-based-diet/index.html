It can be a difficult lifestyle to maintain, but with the right guidelines, you can stay determined to stick to it. In this blog post, we’ll explore some useful tips to help you stay motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet. Staying motivated while on a 90/10 plant-based diet can be a challenge, but it doesn’t have to be. With the right tips and tricks, anyone can stick to their plant-based goals and power through the tough days. Here are a few tips to help you stay motivated on your journey to delicious and nutritious plant-based eating.\nFirst, it’s important to keep track of your progress. Writing down what you eat each day and how you feel can be a great way to stay motivated. You can also create a reward system for yourself and give yourself small incentives when you hit goals. This will help keep you motivated and on track.\nSecond, don’t be afraid to switch up your meals. Variety is the spice of life, and it can help to break the monotony of your diet. Trying new recipes and techniques can help you stay excited about plant-based eating.\nThird, connect with others who are on the same journey. This can be done in-person or online. Talking to others and seeing their successes can be very inspiring and help to keep you motivated.\nFinally, don’t beat yourself up if you slip up. Everyone makes mistakes, and it’s important to forgive yourself. Instead of dwelling on the mistake, focus on what you’ve accomplished and the progress you’ve made.\nStaying motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet doesn’t have to be a challenge. With the right tools and techniques, you can stay on track and enjoy the delicious and nutritious meals that come with a plant-based diet. So get out there and start making some changes. You’ll be feeling amazing in no time.\nAccording to nutrition professor Dr. Robert Ostfeld at Montefiore Medical Center, “a 90/10 plant-based diet has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve heart health, and provide a myriad of other health benefits”[1]. This fact alone should serve as an incentive to stay motivated and stick to such a diet.\nA recent study by the University of Strasbourg found that people on a 90/10 plant-based diet not only lost weight, but were able to sustain the weight loss over time[2]. This indicates that following this type of diet can have long-lasting effects and should be enough to keep you motivated to continue on it.\nCreating clear and realistic goals is essential for staying motivated and on track with your diet. For example, setting an achievable goal such as cooking plant-based meals at home four nights a week or incorporating a new plant-based food into your diet each week are all great ways to stay motivated and stay on track with your diet[3].\nCrafting a Meal Plan for a 90 10 Plant Based Diet Eat plant based healthily Exploring the Benefits of a 90 10 Plant Based Diet An Overview of the 90 10 Plant Based Diet 1. Identify Your Reasons for Switching to a Plant-Based Diet Making the switch to a plant-based diet doesn’t come without its challenges. One of the most difficult is staying motivated. Identifying your reasons for transitioning to a plant-based diet can help you on your journey. People switch for different reasons such as environmental, moral, religious, health, or financial. Taking the time to think through your unique reasons can provide the mental fuel you need to stay inspired and motivated.\nWriting down your reasons for the switch can also remind you of the positive changes that are happening in your body and lifestyle. Refer to this list each day as a reminder of why you are making such a powerful change in your life. Additionally, make sure to set short-term and long-term goals that you can measure progress towards. It’s much easier to stay motivated when you are actively achieving something.\nHaving friends or family join you in the journey can be an invaluable asset. When things are difficult, having someone to fall back on can give you the assistance you need. It could be a source of accountability, someone to ask questions, or just a shoulder to lean on when times get tough. The journey doesn’t have to be a solitary struggle.\nIt is also important to have multiple strategies for staying motivated. Make a list of activities that give you a sense of accomplishment and do them consistently, such as improving your cooking techniques, creating your own recipes, or pre-preparing meals. Whatever your strategy is, make sure it provides motivation to stay on your 90/10 plant-based diet.\n2. Create a Grocery List. Living a plant-based lifestyle can dramatically improve your overall health and wellness. However, making the switch to a plant-based diet and committing to it for the long-term requires time, effort, and staying motivated. To ensure that you remain on track, it’s important to identify your reasons for wanting to pursue a 90/10 plant-based diet. Start by asking yourself why you’d like to make the switch to plant-based foods and note down the answers. Having a clear idea of your motivations will help you stay the course when things get tough or cravings kick in. Additionally, remember that achieving success often requires effort, patience, and setting clear goals. Establish benchmarks that you’d like to hit and then create an action plan to help you reach each one. By committing to your goals, you’ll be more likely to stick to the plant-based lifestyle and make it part of your long-term lifestyle.\n3. Find Plant-Based Recipes You Enjoy. When transitioning to a plant-based diet, the most important step is to identify your reasons for making the switch. Whether you are interested in improving your health, helping the environment, or are simply curious about the new lifestyle, having a clear motive for transitioning to a 90/10 plant-based diet will help you stay motivated. Next, research how to properly follow a balanced plant-based diet so you are getting all the nutrients you need. Figure out what recipes you want to try and create a meal plan to help you stay on track. Make sure to stick to the meal plan over the course of a week and note any changes that you see in your health, lifestyle, or overall satisfaction. Lastly, find a support group or nutritionist who can help you continue to meet your goals. With these tips, you can stay motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet.\n4. Incorporate Variety Into Your Meals. It is important to identify your reasons for switching to a plant-based diet. Whether it is for health, environmental, ethical, or religious reasons, understanding your purpose for making the switch can help foster motivation and commitment to follow through. Setting achievable goals are also crucial in instilling discipline and sticking to a plant-based diet. Slowly transitioning your diet can help ease the process of making dietary changes. Begin by minimizing your animal intake and gradually add more plant-based whole foods to your plate. Finally, surround yourself with like-minded individuals who can provide additional motivation and support every step of the way. A 90/10 plant-based diet is a great place to start and will help guide you on the path that meets your dietary needs and goals.\n5. Connect with Other Plant-Based Dieters. It is important to identify your reasons for switching to a plant-based diet in order to stay motivated on your journey. Take the time to consider your personal health goals, environmental impact, and animal welfare. Knowing your motivation for a diet change will help you stay focused on your goals and make the transition to plant-based eating easier.\nIt can also be helpful to set realistic short-term goals. Decide how many days per week you want to focus on eating a plant-based diet and what types of food you’ll be eating. For instance, some people decide to eat a 90/10 plant-based diet, which is a diet that is made up of 90% plant-based foods and 10% animal products.\nHaving a plan to follow can help you stay on track and prevent feelings of deprivation. Make sure to set yourself up for success by stocking your pantry with items like fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, and legumes.\nFinally, make sure to check in on your progress regularly. Celebrate your victories, no matter how small and don’t be too hard on yourself if you slip up. These tips will help you stay motivated and successful on your plant-based diet journey.\n6. Maintain Perspective and Stay Positive. Staying motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet can be challenging, but it’s worth it. The first step to staying motivated is to identify why you’re making the switch. Is it because you want to lose weight, improve your health, eliminate animal suffering, help the environment, or all of the above? Writing your reasons down on paper or in a journal and referring to it when you need a reminder can be a great way to stay focused and motivated.\nNext, create a plan and stick to it. Making small, achievable goals each day can add up to big changes in the long run. Set up a meal plan and shopping list with healthy, plant-based ingredients and try to stick to it every week. Eating the same meals can help you stay consistent and make it easier to stick with your plant-based diet.\nYou also need to keep your kitchen stocked with foods that you enjoy. This way you can easily prepare healthy meals at home without having to rely on takeout or pre-made foods. Try to keep healthy snacks readily available so you have something to reach for when you’re feeling hungry.\nFinally, don’t forget to take time to enjoy your food. Don’t rush through your meals. Eating in a relaxed environment can be an enjoyable experience. Taking the time to appreciate your meal can help to keep you motivated and make it easier to stick to your 90/10 plant-based diet.\n2. Develop a Healthy Eating Routine Creating a healthy eating routine is essential to staying motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet. Start by planning your meals ahead of time, building a weekly meal plan that incorporates a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and plant-based proteins. Shopping for your meals and prepping your food ahead of time can help you stay on track and stick to your diet. Make sure to include plenty of healthy snacks in your routine as well, such as nuts and seeds, hummus and crackers, and smoothies. Having healthy options on hand makes it easier to reach for something nutritious when you are feeling hungry. Finally, don’t forget to include regular exercise in your routine; physical activity can help to boost your energy levels and keep you feeling motivated and energized.\nI. Setting SMART Goals Eating a plant-based diet is an excellent way to improve your health and wellbeing. A 90/10 plant-based diet is a popular approach, where 90% of your daily food intake is made up of plant-derived foods, while the remaining 10% is of animal origin. To stay motivated on such a diet, try these tips:\nFirstly, focus on the health benefits of a plant-based diet, including reducing your risk of life-threatening diseases and improving your energy levels. Keeping this in mind will help you stay on track, even when faced with tempting alternatives.\nCreate a flexible meal plan for yourself that you can adjust based on the availability of food. Having a plan gives you goals to work towards, which can reduce the risk of slip-ups.\nSet yourselves small rewards for achieving milestones along the way. This gives you something to look forward to, and can help break up your journey into manageable chunks.\nLastly, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Find a support group of like-minded people online, or ask a friend or family member to join you on the journey. With the right support and motivation, you’ll be surprised how quickly you can make progress.\nII. Create a Meal Plan Sticking to a plant-based diet can be difficult, especially when you find it hard to stay motivated. Developing a healthy eating routine is key to ensuring you stay on track with your dietary goals. Start by setting meal times and deciding what to eat ahead of time. Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables is essential to ensure you receive the full range of vitamins and minerals your body needs. Avoiding processed foods and focusing on whole plant-based foods will help ensure you are getting the nutrients your body needs. Additionally, stay hydrated and aim to get in at least 8 glasses of water a day. This will keep you feeling energized and help you stay focused on your dietary goals. Finally, plan for snacks in addition to meals. Having healthy snacks available will help ensure you don’t have to reach for less healthy alternatives when cravings strike.\n3. Prioritize Exercise and Self-Care Staying motivated while sticking to a 90/10 plant-based diet can be challenging at times. It is important to prioritize exercise and self-care as part of your routine. Exercise can help increase both your body’s metabolism and your mental wellbeing. Additionally make sure to take time to nourish yourself with restful activities such as yoga and meditation. Focusing on relaxation and calming activities can help reduce stress, which can often lead to unhealthy cravings. Taking time for yourself can make an enormous difference on your journey to a healthier lifestyle.\nI. Exercise Exercising regularly and practicing self-care are essential for staying motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet. Making time for physical activities such as yoga, walking, jogging, or biking can help you to stick to your diet goals. Set aside time for yourself each day to relax and practice self-care. Try to find activities that you enjoy and make them a priority. Practicing yoga, meditating, journaling, or engaging in creative activities can help to reduce stress and stay motivated. In addition, having a support system of friends and family members who understand your dietary goals can also be helpful.\nA. Benefits of Physical Exercise Exercise and self-care can be great to help boost motivation. Not only will breaks from dieting help occupy your mind and provide you with something fun to do, but both exercise and self-care can help boost confidence. Additionally, exercise can also increase levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in charge of influencing motivation and reward. Break up a lengthy diet plan with short-term goals that include exercise and self-care. A walk around the block when feeling unmotivated or a soothing spa day when feeling overwhelmed can help boost your overall mood and help you stay motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet. Even better, a combination of the two can be incredibly beneficial.\nB. Finding an Exercise Routine that Works for You Exercise can be an important part of maintaining motivation. Regularly getting in physical activity helps keep the body energized and active, which can provide an added boost when it comes to getting through the day. Additionally, taking time for self-care is beneficial for both body and mind. Making sure you’re getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water and eating nutrient-dense foods will help to fuel the body and give the brain an extra burst of energy when needed. Making these activities a priority can help to keep motivation high.\nII. Self-Care Exercise and self-care are important components of staying motivated on a 90/10 plant-based diet. Part of the motivation comes from feeling good in your body, so regular exercise will help to strengthen your muscles and boost your overall health. Taking time to practice self-care can also help you stay strong mentally and emotionally. Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity each day to ensure your body is getting the exercise it needs. Additionally, make sure to set aside time to do things that make you feel relaxed and fulfilled such as reading, yoga, journaling or creative hobbies. Doing so can help keep your motivation levels up and your overall health in check.\nA. Developing a Self-Care Routine Exercise can help to keep both your body and mind motivated when maintaining a 90/10 plant-based diet. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity each day to provide a sense of accomplishment and balance. Additionally, don’t forget to take time for yourself. Self-care is essential for clearing your mind and creating a healthy mindset. This way, maintaining your diet doesn’t feel like a chore, but a lifestyle. Incorporate activities like meditating, reading, and yoga for a healthy dose of relaxation. Lastly, take the time to be mindful of your successes, both big and small. Celebrate the small wins like not succumbing to a temptation or trying a new recipe. Reminding yourself of your successes can be a powerful source of motivation.\nB. Connecting with Loved Ones Exercising regularly and taking care of yourself are both essential for staying motivated with your 90/10 plant-based diet. Start with a realistic physical activity goal that fits your lifestyle and create a weekly schedule you can stick to. It could be something as simple as going for a 20-minute walk around the block every day or doing a few yoga poses in your living room. Taking care of your mental health is also crucial in order to stay motivated on your diet. Spend some time meditating, take a hot bath or read a book to help relax and refocus. Scheduling time for yourself can also help keep you motivated to stick to your 90/10 plant-based diet.
