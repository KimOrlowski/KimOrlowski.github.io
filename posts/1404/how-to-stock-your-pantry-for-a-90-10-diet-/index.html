Additionally, having items on-hand such as nut butters, olive oil, and fresh fruit are also a good idea.\nAccording to nutrition expert Shawn M. Talbott, PhD, “The key to a successful 90/10 diet is to focus on eating full, healthy meals the majority of the time, while allowing occasional indulgences that don’t derail your efforts in the long run.”\n9 Healthy Food Options for a 90 10 Diet Max Weight Loss Diet 1.
