It works on the simple principle of eating healthy, clean, nutritious foods 90% of the time, allowing for the other 10% to come from more indulgent, sugar-filled treats. This strategy allows consumers to still enjoy indulgences without having to go off their diet completely. The theory is that as long as the 90/10 ratio is followed, there is less guilt associated with eating unhealthy foods. This allows consumers to indulge in their favorite foods while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\nThe 90/10 strategy is attractive to people who are trying to make sustainable, lifelong changes in their diet. It sets realistic expectations and doesn’t deprive people of their favorite indulgences, allowing for a more balanced approach to dieting and fewer instances of ‘dieting fatigue.’ In addition to this, the 10% indulgence also helps to minimize cravings and binges which can lead to undoing all the hard work of the 90%.\nThe 90/10 strategy also helps to build healthy eating habits. By consistently following the 90/10 ratio, people are able to recognize what foods should be eaten more often and what should be avoided more often. This helps to instill healthy habits which can carry into the future.\nFinally, the 90/10 strategy is a great way to practice mindful eating.

The strategy also focuses on portion control, to ensure that you are not overindulging in these less healthy foods.\nThe 90/10 Nutrition Strategy also encourages mindful eating, to ensure that you focus on your body’s needs and not overeat. It also emphasizes the importance of listening to your body when it comes to hunger, so that you can respond to its cues. This strategy encourages you to be aware of your body and what it needs, rather than simply following a set diet plan.\nFinally, the 90/10 Nutrition Strategy also promotes regular physical activity, to ensure that you remain active and fit.

The basic idea is that 90 percent of your food choices should be based on whole, unprocessed foods, with only 10 percent of your diet coming from “fun” or indulgent foods.

Eating a variety of whole foods, such as fresh produce, lean proteins, and healthy fats, provides essential nutrients and helps provide a balanced meal. Furthermore, allowing for occasional treats and indulgences 10% of the time helps prevent feelings of deprivation and keeps you from feeling restricted.\nThis strategy can be beneficial for weight loss and gaining muscle. By following the 90/10 strategy, you can limit your calorie intake and eat healthy foods that provide essential nutrients. This will make it easier to reach your weight loss or muscle gain goals.
