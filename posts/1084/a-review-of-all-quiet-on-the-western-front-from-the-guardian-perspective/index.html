The soldiers may be caught in a seemingly endless cycle of violence and death, but they still find moments of joy in the small things.</p><p>The characters are well-developed and show a range of emotions in the face of their brutal surroundings. The reader is able to empathize with the characters in a very real way, and the overall impression of the book is one of quiet sadness and respect for the human toll of warfare.

This is something that is easy to overlook in a war novel, yet is explored in detail throughout the book. The characters are humanized, and their desire to help each other in difficult moments is highlighted.</p><p>Overall, The Guardian&rsquo;s review of All Quiet On The Western Front is a testament to the enduring power of the book. The story is both heart-wrenching and inspirational, showing how people can connect even in the midst of the horrors of war.
